\title{Order variables of a dataset according to Spec}
\usage{
xportr_order(
  .df,
  metadata = NULL,
  domain = NULL,
  verbose = NULL,
  metacore = deprecated()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.df}{A data frame of CDISC standard.}

\item{metadata}{A data frame containing variable level metadata. See
'Metadata' section for details.}

\item{domain}{Appropriate CDISC dataset name, e.g. ADAE, DM. Used to subset
the metadata object.}

\item{verbose}{The action this function takes when an action is taken on the
dataset or function validation finds an issue. See 'Messaging' section for
details. Options are 'stop', 'warn', 'message', and 'none'}

\item{metacore}{\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated}{\figure{lifecycle-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='[Deprecated]'}}}{\strong{[Deprecated]}} Previously used to pass
metadata now renamed with \code{metadata}}
}
\value{
Dataframe that has been re-ordered according to spec
}
\description{
The \code{dplyr::arrange()} function is used to order the columns of the dataframe.
Any variables that are missing an order value are appended to the end of the dataframe
after all of the variables that have an order.
}
\section{Messaging}{
 \code{var_ord_msg()} is the primary messaging tool for
\code{xportr_order()}. There are two primary messages that are output from
\code{var_ord_msg()}. The first is the "moved" variables. These are the variables
that were not found in the metadata file and moved to the end of the
dataset. A message will be generated noting the number, if any, of
variables that were moved to the end of the dataset. If any variables were
moved, and the 'verbose' argument is 'stop', 'warn', or 'message', a
message will be generated detailing the variables that were moved.

The second primary message is the number of variables that were in the
dataset, but not in the correct order. A message will be generated noting
the number, if any, of variables that have been reordered. If any variables
were reordered, and the 'verbose' argument is 'stop', 'warn', or 'message',
a message will be generated detailing the variables that were reordered.
}

\section{Metadata}{
 The argument passed in the 'metadata' argument can either
be a metacore object, or a data.frame containing the data listed below. If
metacore is used, no changes to options are required.

For data.frame 'metadata' arguments three columns must be present:
\enumerate{
\item Domain Name - passed as the 'xportr.domain_name' option. Default:
"dataset". This is the column subset by the 'domain' argument in the
function.
\item Variable Name - passed as the 'xportr.variable_name' option.
Default: "variable". This is used to match columns in '.df' argument and
the metadata.
\item Variable Order - passed as the 'xportr.order_name' option.
Default: "order". These values used to arrange the order of the variables.
If the values of order metadata are not numeric, they will be coerced to
prevent alphabetical sorting of numeric values.
