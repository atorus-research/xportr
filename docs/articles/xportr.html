<p>We will demonstrate the 6 main functions within <code>xportr</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>xportr_type()</li>
<li>xportr_length()</li>
<li>xportr_label()</li>
<li>xportr_df_label()</li>
<li>xportr_varnames()</li>
<li>xportr_write()</li>
</ul>
<p>The demo will make use of a small <strong>adsl</strong> data set that is included in this package. Other vignettes within this package make use of the <a href="https://github.com/atorus-research/CDISC_pilot_replication">CDISC Pilot Study Data</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>adsl</strong> has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>24 observations</li>
<li>23 variables</li>
<li>Data types other than character and numeric</li>
<li>No labels on variables</li>
<li>No label for data set</li>
</ul>

<p><br></p>
<p>In order to make use of the functions within <code>xportr</code> you will need to create two R data frame objects that contain your data set specifications. For our examples, we have referenced specifications files contained in the package. Here we have called those two objects <strong>var_spec</strong> and <strong>data_spec</strong>. Please note, the change of variable names for each. You will most likely need to do some pre-processing of your spec sheets after loading in the spec files for them to work appropriately with the <code>xportr</code> functions.</p>

<p>Next we can apply the lengths from a variable level specification file to the data frame. <code>xportr_length</code> will identify variables that are missing from your specification file. The function will also alert you to how many lengths have been applied successfully. Before we apply the lengths lets verify that no lengths have been applied to the original dataframe.</p>

<p>There are several constraints placed upon variable naming. According to modern CDISC Implementation guides and the latest <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/136460/download">FDA conformance guide</a>, all ADaM variable names must be:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>no more than 8 characters in length</p></li>
<li><p>start with a letter (not an underscore)</p></li>
<li><p>be comprised of only uppercase letters (A-Z), numerals (0-9)</p></li>
<li><p>free of non-ASCII text, symbols, or underscores. Note: Underscores are permitted only for legacy studies started on or before Dec 17th, 2016</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For strings containing variable names <code><a href="../reference/xportr_tidy_rename.html">xportr_tidy_rename()</a></code> was designed to identify and rename variables into compliance. Thus, you can use this function to rename the spec file variables or column names on the fly. Below, we use it’s default options to tidy names for submission compliance.</p>

The function uses a step-wise renaming algorithm to maintain the original variable names characteristics as much as possible. Below is the view of the the old variable names juxtaposed the new.</p>

<p>You may have observed in the previous output that all variables starting with a number were bundled and relocated to the END of the term. For example, 1d. Lungs" became “LUNGS1D”. To maintain the numeric prefix at the start (or left-hand side), users can set a letter [A-Z] to prefix the numeric prefix. Below we set <code>letter_for_num_prefix</code> to “x” and <code>relo_2_end</code> to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
<p>Second, if your organization holds an ontology of controlled terms, you can then map non-compliant variable names to any desired result using the <code>dict_dat</code> argument. It’s essentially provides a “find any replace” functionality for any instance of the term(s) found in the data. In the example below, we want “subject id” to be portrayed as “SUBJID”. Thus, we created a data.frame called <code>my_dictionary</code> that maps that relationship.</p>

<p>Finally, we arrive at exporting the R data frame object as a xpt file with the function <code>xportr_write</code>. The xpt file will be written directly to your current working directory. To make it more interesting, we have put together all five function with the magrittr pipe. A user can now coerce, apply length, variable labels, data set label and write out their final xpt file in one pipe! Appropriate warnings and messages will be supplied to a user for any potential issues before sending off to standard clinical data set validator application or data reviewers.</p>
