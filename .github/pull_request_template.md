### Thank you for your Pull Request! 

We have developed a Pull Request template to aid you and our reviewers.  Completing the below tasks helps to ensure our reviewers can maximize their time on your code as well as making sure the xportr codebase remains robust and consistent.  

### The scope of `{xportr}`

`{xportr}`'s scope is to enable R users to write out submission compliant `xpt` files that can be delivered to a Health Authority or to downstream validation software programs.  We see labels, lengths, types, ordering and formats from a dataset specification object (SDTM and ADaM) as being our primary focus. We also see messaging and warnings to users around applying information from the specification file as a primary focus. Please make sure your Pull Request meets this **scope of {xportr}**. If your Pull Request moves beyond this scope, please get in touch with the `{xportr}` team on [slack](https://pharmaverse.slack.com/archives/C030EB2M4GM) or create an issue to discuss.

Please check off each task box as an acknowledgment that you completed the task. This checklist is part of the Github Action workflows and the Pull Request will not be merged into the `devel` branch until you have checked off each task.
